## Preface
I have long loved to teach, from my first job at [Aetna][1] I was helping people get better at what they do. Since I started working at [Koansys][2] I feel as though I have been just tredding water trying to gain as much knowledge as I can to stay afloat. But now I feel as though I am at a place again where I can start to help people once again, and these next few posts are going to be a tutorial on [Angular.js][3]. I hope that these next few posts not only help someone get started with Angular, but also reinvigoriate my love for teaching. Thank you for putting up with these and feel free to [tweet me][4] if you like these posts.
