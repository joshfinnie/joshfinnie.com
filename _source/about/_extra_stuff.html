      <h2>What I use...</h2>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>My main computer, which was given to me by my employer, is a Mid 2011 Macbook Air. I love the form factor and weight. It is almost all the computer I need. The downsizes I have found in using this laptop is that I sometimes run short on RAM, only being allowed to have 4GBs and only having one Thunderbolt plug, especially since Apple has made almost all adapters Thunderbolt based. Most of the time my Macbook Air is attached, via HDMI, to a 27" Samsung monitor. This gives me the realestate needed to get my daily work done. For inputs, I currently use a Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboard, which I love for its ergonomic design and a Apple Magic Trackpad.</p>
        <p>Other things I use daily are my Sennheiser HD 380 Pro headphones plugged into a Audioengine D1 when I am listening to music, or my Apple headphones when using skype. I also have a Nexus 4 which I use as my daily phone and a Nexus 7 when I am feeling like using a tablet.</p>
        <p>I also have a mid 2011 24" iMac attached to a few external hard drives. We use this computer mostly for household stuff and backup.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>As a web application developer, most of my time is spent on the web or coding for the web. I have recently switched back to Firefox after a long time using Chrome. I have found that the latest release of Chrome kills my memory when I keep a lot of tabs open. Sure I can change my ways, but Firefox seems to handle it for now. I use Google Apps for both personal and work, including Gmail, Google Docs, and Calendar. When coding I usually use Sublime Text. However, I am trying to get more use to using Vim on a regular basis. I have been experiementing with CodeKit and SCSS.</p>
