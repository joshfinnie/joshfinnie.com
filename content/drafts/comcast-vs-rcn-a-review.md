It has been about six months since I have left [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com/), and to no one's surprize I am not looking back. My ability to get internet through [RCN](http://www.rcn.com/) has made me realize no one should suffer through dealing with an internet provider who does not care for its customers! This fact was only made more clear after listening to [Ryan Block try to cancel Comcast](https://soundcloud.com/ryan-block-10/comcastic-service).

My hatred for Comcast runs deep. It has been my sole provider of internet for over 10 years. It didn't start bad, but with time, the constant let-down was almost too much to bare. A lot of my complants below were only realized once I left Comcast; the hold they have on you is strong and is the main reason these sort of monopolies should be ended. The TL:DR summary can be broken down into a few bullet points:

* Their customer service is a joke
* They blantantly lie about their internet speeds
* They have no ability to keep their infrastructor afloat
*
