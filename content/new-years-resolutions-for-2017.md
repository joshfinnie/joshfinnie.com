It's that time of year again, time to set forth upon the new year and cast my hopes and dreams for 2017. It is also time to reflect on how I did in 2016. And, after reviewing 2016's resolutions, I can say this year is going to be more focused; I am not going to be as ambitious with my resolutions as I was last year. So, with that, let's see my 2017 resolutions...

## My 2017 Resolutions

* Restart my efforts in blogging. Would really like to get 12+ posts out this year (1 a month).
* Speak at a national tech conference.
* Start to learn [Go](https://golang.org/).
* Restart my React.js/Express.js tutorial. Get 1,000 readers. 
* Improve my photography and start publishing photos to somewhere else besides Instagram.

## My 2016 Resolutions Results

<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Continue my forward progress on blogging. Would really like to get 12+ posts out this year (1 a month).</span> &#8211; Well, I completely failed this goal.<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Improve my photography and start publishing photos to somewhere else besides Instagram.</span> &#8211; I think I took a lot of photos, but this website might not be the best for photography.<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Become a contributor to a major open source project.</span> &#8211; I need to bite the bullet here, but I just didn't have the drive this year.<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Start to learn [C](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).</span> &#8211; I do want to learn more about Computer Science, maybe C isn't the right thing...<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Speak at a national tech conference.</span> &#8211; Unfortunately, didn't have a chance to do this... moving it to 2017 Resolutions.<br>
<span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i> Continue to give talks at my local meetups (I have a goal of 6 talks).</span> &#8211; I ended up giving five talks to meetups around DC, and a few internally at TrackMaven. This was a solid win in my books.<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Continue & Complete my [React.js tutorial](http://www.joshfinnie.com/blog/reactjs-tutorial-part-1/)</span><br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Participate and complete the 2016 [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/).</span> &#8211; Ugg, who has the time for this? Still would love to attempt to accomplish this, but it's so hard to dedicate any time to.<br>
<span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i> Finish 12 audio books.</span> &#8211; Audio books are absolutely great!<br>
<span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i> Become better at the game of [Magic the Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/).</span> &#8211; Practice makes perfect, and luckily I am getting a lot more practice in of late.<br>
<span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i> Lose weight.</span> &#8211;  This is always going to be a struggle for me, but I feel like I am heading in the right direction.<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Beat my mother in a 5k.</span> &#8211;  Unfortunately, my mother can still out-run me. I hate running, but would have loved to see this goal happen.<br>
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Ride the [Seagull Century](http://www.seagullcentury.org/).</span> &#8211; This one really just slipped my mind. I need to do better to make sure I am on the right track for goals in 2017. <br>

## Conclusion

Well, 4 out of 15 goals completed. That's terrible. To be honest with everyone, I completely forgot about this list and my goals for 2016. This is a huge problem, so for 2017, we are cutting it back, way back! Sure, I am not thrilled with my performance for 2016, but you have to roll with the punches. To 2017!
