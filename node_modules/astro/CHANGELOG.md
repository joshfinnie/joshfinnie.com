# astro

## 0.20.3

### Patch Changes

- 290f2032: Fix knownEntrypoint warning for \_\_astro_hoisted_scripts.js

## 0.20.2

### Patch Changes

- 788c769d: # Hoisted scripts

  This change adds support for hoisted scripts, allowing you to bundle scripts together for a page and hoist them to the top (in the head):

  ```astro
  <script hoist>
    // Anything goes here!
  </script>
  ```

- Updated dependencies [5d2ea578]
  - @astrojs/parser@0.20.2

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- ff92be63: Add a new "astro preview" command

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- affcd04f: **[BREAKING CHANGE]** stop bundling, building, and processing public files. This fixes an issue where we weren't actually honoring the "do not process" property of the public directory.

  If you were using the `public/` directory as expected and not using it to build files for you, then this should not be a breaking change. However, will notice that these files are no longer bundled.

  If you were using the `public/` directory to build files (for example, like `public/index.scss`) then you can expect this to no longer work. As per the correct Astro documentation.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 239065e2: **[BREAKING]** Replace the Collections API with new file-based routing.

  This is a breaking change which impacts collections, pagination, and RSS support.
  Runtime warnings have been added to help you migrate old code to the new API.
  If you have trouble upgrading, reach out on https://astro.build/chat

  This change was made due to confusion around our Collection API, which many users found difficult to use. The new file-based routing approach should feel more familiar to anyone who has used Next.js or SvelteKit.

  Documentation added:

  - https://astro-docs-git-main-pikapkg.vercel.app/core-concepts/routing
  - https://astro-docs-git-main-pikapkg.vercel.app/guides/pagination
  - https://astro-docs-git-main-pikapkg.vercel.app/guides/rss
  - https://astro-docs-git-main-pikapkg.vercel.app/reference/api-reference#getstaticpaths

- 239065e2: Adds support for Astro.resolve

  `Astro.resolve()` helps with creating URLs relative to the current Astro file, allowing you to reference files within your `src/` folder.

  Astro _does not_ resolve relative links within HTML, such as images:

  ```html
  <img src="../images/penguin.png" />
  ```

  The above will be sent to the browser as-is and the browser will resolve it relative to the current **page**. If you want it to be resolved relative to the .astro file you are working in, use `Astro.resolve`:

  ```astro
  <img src={Astro.resolve('../images/penguin.png')} />
  ```

- 239065e2: Adds support for client:only hydrator

  The new `client:only` hydrator allows you to define a component that should be skipped during the build and only hydrated in the browser.

  In most cases it is best to render placeholder content during the build, but that may not always be feasible if an NPM dependency attempts to use browser APIs as soon as is imported.

  **Note** If more than one renderer is included in your Astro config, you need to include a hint to determine which renderer to use. Renderers will be matched to the name provided in your Astro config, similar to `<MyComponent client:only="@astrojs/renderer-react" />`. Shorthand can be used for `@astrojs` renderers, i.e. `<MyComponent client:only="react" />` will use `@astrojs/renderer-react`.

  An example usage:

  ```jsx
  ---
  import BarChart from '../components/BarChart.jsx';
  ---

  <BarChart client:only />
  /**
   * If multiple renderers are included in the Astro config,
   * this will ensure that the component is hydrated with
   * the Preact renderer.
   */
  <BarChart client:only="preact" />
  /**
   * If a custom renderer is required, use the same name
   * provided in the Astro config.
   */
  <BarChart client:only="my-custom-renderer" />
  ```

  This allows you to import a chart component dependent on d3.js while making sure that the component isn't rendered at all at build time.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- f67e8f5: New Collections API (createCollection)

  BREAKING CHANGE: The expected return format from createCollection() has been changed. Visit https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/collections to learn the new API.

  This feature was implemented with backwards-compatible deprecation warnings, to help you find and update pages that are using the legacy API.

- 40c882a: Fix url to find page with "index" at the end file name
- 0340b0f: Adds support for the client:media hydrator

  The new `client:media` hydrator allows you to define a component that should only be loaded when a media query matches. An example usage:

  ```jsx
  ---
  import Sidebar from '../components/Sidebar.jsx';
  ---

  <Sidebar client:media="(max-width: 700px)" />
  ```

  This allows you to define components which, for example, only run on mobile devices. A common example is a slide-in sidebar that is needed to add navigation to a mobile app, but is never displayed in desktop view.

  Since Astro components can have expressions, you can move common media queries to a module for sharing. For example here are defining:

  **media.js**

  ```js
  export const MOBILE = '(max-width: 700px)';
  ```

  And then you can reference this in your page:

  **index.astro**

  ```jsx
  import Sidebar from '../components/Sidebar.jsx';
  import { MOBILE } from '../media.js';
  ---(<Sidebar client:media={MOBILE} />);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- e89a99f: This includes the props passed to a hydration component when generating the hash/id. This prevents multiple instances of the same component with differing props to be treated as the same component when hydrated by Astro.
- b8af49f: Added sass support
- a7e6666: compile javascript to target Node v12.x
- fb8bf7e: Allow multiple Astro servers to be running simultaneously by choosing random ports if the defaults are taken.
- 294a656: Adds support for global style blocks via `<style global>`

  Be careful with this escape hatch! This is best reserved for uses like importing styling libraries like Tailwind, or changing global CSS variables.

- 8f4562a: Improve slot support, adding support for named slots and fallback content within `slot` elements.

  See the new [Slots documentation](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/astro-components/#slots) for more information.

  - @astrojs/renderer-react@0.1.5

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a7b6de: ## Adds directive syntax for component hydration

  This change updates the syntax for partial hydration from `<Button:load />` to `<Button client:load />`.

  **Why?**

  Partial hydration is about to get super powers! This clears the way for more dynamic partial hydration, i.e. `<MobileMenu client:media="(max-width: 40em)" />`.

  **How to upgrade**

  Just update `:load`, `:idle`, and `:visible` to match the `client:load` format, thats it! Don't worry, the original syntax is still supported but it's recommended to future-proof your project by updating to the newer syntax.

## 0.16.3

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- d396943: Add support for [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark#readme) and [`rehype`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype#readme) plugins for both `.md` pages and `.astro` pages using the [`<Markdown>`](/docs/guides/markdown-content.md) component.

  For example, the `astro.config.mjs` could be updated to include the following. [Read the Markdown documentation](/docs/guides/markdown-content.md) for more information.

  > **Note** Enabling custom `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` removes Astro's built-in support for [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) support, [Footnotes](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-footnotes) syntax, [Smartypants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants). You must explicitly add these plugins to your `astro.config.mjs` file, if desired.

  ```js
  export default {
    markdownOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: ['remark-slug', ['remark-autolink-headings', { behavior: 'prepend' }]],
      rehypePlugins: ['rehype-slug', ['rehype-autolink-headings', { behavior: 'prepend' }]],
    },
  };
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d396943]
- Updated dependencies [f83407e]
  - @astrojs/markdown-support@0.2.0

## 0.15.5

### Patch Changes

- 7b4c97c: Adds support for `hydrationPolyfills` in renderers

  Renderers can not specify polyfills that must run before the component code runs for hydration:

  ```js
  export default {
    name: '@matthewp/my-renderer',
    server: './server.js',
    client: './client.js',
    hydrationPolyfills: ['./my-polyfill.js'],
  };
  ```

  These will still wait for hydration to occur, but will run before the component script does.

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- 8865158: Fixes postcss bug with the 'from' property

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- a136c85: **This is a breaking change!**

  Astro props are now accessed from the `Astro.props` global. This change is meant to make prop definitions more ergonomic, leaning into JavaScript patterns you already know (destructuring and defaults). Astro components previously used a prop syntax borrowed from [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs#1_export_creates_a_component_prop), but it became clear that this was pretty confusing for most users.

  ```diff
   ---
  + const { text = 'Hello world!' } = Astro.props;
  - export let text = 'Hello world!';
   ---

   <div>{text}</div>
  ```

  [Read more about the `.astro` syntax](https://docs.astro.build/syntax/#data-and-props)

  ***

  ### How do I define what props my component accepts?

  Astro frontmatter scripts are TypeScript! Because of this, we can leverage TypeScript types to define the shape of your props.

  ```ts
  ---
  export interface Props {
    text?: string;
  }
  const { text = 'Hello world!' } = Astro.props as Props;
  ---
  ```

  > **Note** Casting `Astro.props as Props` is a temporary workaround. We expect our Language Server to handle this automatically soon!

  ### How do I access props I haven't explicitly defined?

  One of the great things about this change is that it's straight-forward to access _any_ props. Just use `...props`!

  ```ts
  ---
  export interface Props {
    text?: string;
    [attr: string]: unknown;
  }
  const { text = 'Hello world!', ...props } = Astro.props as Props;
  ---
  ```

  ### What about prop validation?

  We considered building prop validation into Astro, but decided to leave that implementation up to you! This way, you can use any set of tools you like.

  ```ts
  ---
  const { text = 'Hello world!' } = Astro.props;

  if (typeof text !== 'string') throw new Error(`Expected "text" to be of type "string" but recieved "${typeof string}"!`);
  ---
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 8ff7998: Enable Snowpack's [built-in HMR support](https://www.snowpack.dev/concepts/hot-module-replacement) to enable seamless live updates while editing.
- ffb6380: Support for dynamic Markdown through the content attribute.
- 8ff7998: Enabled Snowpack's built-in HMR engine for Astro pages
- 643c880: **This is a breaking change**

  Updated the rendering pipeline for `astro` to truly support any framework.

  For the vast majority of use cases, `astro` should _just work_ out of the box. Astro now depends on `@astrojs/renderer-preact`, `@astrojs/renderer-react`, `@astrojs/renderer-svelte`, and `@astrojs/renderer-vue`, rather than these being built into the core library. This opens the door for anyone to contribute additional renderers for Astro to support their favorite framework, as well as the ability for users to control which renderers should be used.

  **Features**

  - Expose a pluggable interface for controlling server-side rendering and client-side hydration
  - Allows components from different frameworks to be nested within each other.
    > Note: `svelte` currently does support non-destructive hydration, so components from other frameworks cannot currently be nested inside of a Svelte component. See https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4308.

  **Breaking Changes**

  - To improve compiler performance, improve framework support, and minimize JS payloads, any children passed to hydrated components are automatically wrapped with an `<astro-fragment>` element.

### Patch Changes

- 3d20623: Fixed a bug where Astro did not conform to JSX Expressions' [`&&`](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator) syntax.

  Also fixed a bug where `<span data-attr="" />` would render as `<span data-attr="undefined" />`.

- 46871d2: Fixed bug where a class attribute was added to the doctype
- c9d833e: Fixed a number of bugs and re-enabled the `@astrojs/renderer-vue` renderer
- ce30bb0: Temporarily disable `@astrojs/renderer-vue` while we investigate an issue with installation
