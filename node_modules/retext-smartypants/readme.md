## API

### `retext().use(smartypants[, options])`

Replaces dumb/straight/typewriter punctuation marks with smart/curly punctuation
marks.

##### `options`

###### `options.quotes`

Create smart quotes (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Converts straight double and single quotes to smart double or single quotes.

###### `options.ellipses`

Create smart ellipses (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Converts triple dot characters (with or without spaces between) into a single
unicode ellipsis character

###### `options.backticks`

Create smart quotes from backticks (`boolean` or `'all'`, default: `true`).

When `true`, converts double back-ticks into an opening double quote, and
double straight single quotes into a closing double quote.

When `'all'`: does the preceding and converts single back-ticks into an
opening single quote, and a straight single quote into a closing single
smart quote.

> **Note**: Quotes can not be `true` when `backticks` is `'all'`;

###### `options.dashes`

Create smart dashes (`boolean` or `'oldschool'`, `'inverted'`, default: `true`).

When `true`, converts two dashes into an em-dash character.

When `'oldschool'`, converts two dashes into an en-dash, and three dashes into
an em-dash.

When `'inverted'`, converts two dashes into an em-dash, and three dashes into
an en-dash.
