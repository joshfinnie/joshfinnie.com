[**retext**][retext] is a natural language processor powered by [plugins][]
part of the [unified][] [collective][].

*   API by [**unified**][unified]
*   Parses natural language to the tree with [`retext-latin`][latin]
*   [**nlcst**][nlcst] syntax tree
*   [Plugins][] transform the tree
*   Compiles the tree to markdown using [`retext-stringify`][stringify]

Don‚Äôt need the parser?  Or the compiler?  [That‚Äôs OK][unified-usage].
