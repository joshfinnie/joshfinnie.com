15 years of blogging.
That is a very long time.
And what have I learned?
Is it easier to blog today than it was a decade and a half ago?
I thought it would be fun to write a retrospective on the 15 years of this blog.
Share what I learned and what I would change.

Luckily, I have been tracking changes for this blog [here](https://github.com/joshfinnie/joshfinnie.com).
Given that I have over 1000 commits, I am sure there are some insights I can share.
Although, I am pretty sure the majority of those commits are just keeping myself sane in the wild world of Javascript dependencies.
