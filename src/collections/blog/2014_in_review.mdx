Better late than never, I wanted to give a personal 2014 Year in Review.
And what a year this has been!
I changed jobs, got married, double-downed on my open source efforts...
2014 was a very busy year.
But this is going to just be a high-level overview of what this year was for me.
I hope this becomes a place for reflection in the upcoming years, so here it goes.

### Here are some numbers

- 1 new job. I joined [TrackMaven](http://trackmaven.com) in March of 2014. Even though I was super sad to leave [Koansys](http://koansys.com) and the [iSat](http://science.nasa.gov/iSat/) project, the growth and happiness I have experienced in these 10+ months have been amazing.
- 1 new wife. I was finally able to marry the woman of my dreams after 10 years of being together and 4 years of engagement! Woot!
- Pretty good adoption of [BeerLedge](https://www.beerledge.com). Even though I am hoping for 2015 to be the breakout year for BeerLedge, I was excited by the improvements it was.

- Similarly good adoption of this site. My [goal](/blog/new-years-resolutions-for-2015-and-2014-review/) is to blog a lot more, so hopefully that number goes up drastically!

- I had about 750 commits to open-source projects in 2014 with another 400 commits to private repos on GitHub.
- I gave [5 talks](/talks/) in 2014.

That's 2014 in numbers. Here's to a great 2015!
