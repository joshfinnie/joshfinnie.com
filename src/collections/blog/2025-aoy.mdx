As 2025 draws to a close, I've been reflecting on the music that defined my year.
This was a phenomenal year for music across genres, from experimental hip-hop to art rock to electronic pop.
Below are my top 20 albums of 2025, plus two honorable mentions that technically came out in late 2024 but felt too essential to leave off this list.

### 1. Clipse - Let God Sort Them Out
