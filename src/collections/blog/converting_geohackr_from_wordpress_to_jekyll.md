For the past couple of months I have been working on a Geography based blog called [GeoHackr](http://geohackr.com/). This blog is currently run off a WordPress blog hosted at [Bluehost](http://bluehost.com/), and, now that I have found this wonderful blogging program Jekyll, I am wondering if a full-blown Wordpress implementation is actually worth it.

There are a lot of things to consider. Fortunately enough, GeoHackr only has 20+ posts currently writte; if there were more than this I am not sure it would be worth the time it will take to transfer GeoHackr to Jekyll. Other things that I have to take into consideration is the plug-ins that I will be loosing in this transfer. Love it or hate it, WordPress is an amazing blogging platform.

Luckily, there are ways around the WordPress plug-in problem. Most of the plug-ins actually have websites that will give you the code needed to install the plug-in on any platform. And in other areas, there are somethings that you can find that work better than what is given through plug-ins. For example, on this blog; I started using Disqus for comments and I have fallen in love with this new system.
You can see what the blog posts look like by going to the test site: [GeoHackr Test](http://geohackr.com/) (Edit: Changed link to real site.).
