description: "A brief review of the music I found and fell in love with across all of 2024."
---

I have a deep affinity to music.
I listed to almost 25 thousand minutes of music in 2024.
Surprisingly, that is a bit below my average.
Though, I am eternally grateful that I have a job that allows me to just play music all day.

I am not sure when I started, but I wrote a small command-line application that prints out my most played artists of the week.
I wrote this in Rust as an opportunity to learn how to write command-line applications that interact with an API.
You can find the code [here](https://github.com/joshfinnie/lfmc) if it is an interest to you.
However, more than the early Rust code I wrote I thought it would be interesting to give a bit more context for the music I loved in 2024.

There are two categories that I am going to talk share below.
First, I'll share my top albums that were released in 2024.
Second, I will share the albums that are new to me, but were not newly released.
I hope you enjoy a trip down my musical history of 2024.
I tried to give a bit of explanation as to what each of these entries meant to me for some extra flavor.

**Please note**, I do not have the energy nor the will power to rank these.
There is no particular order to the list below!

## New Albums of 2024

* [Bando Stone and The New World](https://album.link/us/i/1757678472) by [Childish Gambino](https://www.childishgambino.com/)

  Absolutely amazing first song.
  And the rest of the album does not disappoint.
  I think this is the strongest album Childish Gambino put out so far.

* [I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU](https://album.link/us/i/1760036431) by [JPEGMAFIA](https://www.jpegmafia.net/)

  There are a few central themes about my music that I thoroughly enjoyed this year.
  One of them is loud, chaotic music.
  Even though I don't think this is JPEGMAFIA's most chaotic album, it is a great one and worth a listen.

* [As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again](https://album.link/us/i/1733117575) by [The Decemberists](https://www.decemberists.com/)

  What can be said here.
  The Decemberists are great.
  I have seen them live 5 times already and would never give up an opportunity.
  And I cannot wait to hear "Joan in the Garden" live.
  I must have listened to it this year 100 times.

* [Rome](https://album.link/us/i/1767454077) by [The National](https://www.americanmary.com/)

  I absolutely love The National.
  They still, to this day, are my most listened band.
  And I had a _terrible_ time the only time I saw them live.
  So having this album, a live concert, which sounds amazing is truly a gift!

* [13" Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grip](https://album.link/us/i/1750095083) by [Xiu Xiu](https://www.xiuxiu.org/)

  Xiu Xiu is another band in the noise/chaos camp.
  They are a joy to listen to, but you really have to be in the mood.
  I was happy to get this album though, as it is probably the most approachable album of theirs yet.

* [Short n' Sweet](https://album.link/us/i/1750307020) by [Sabrina Carpenter](https://www.sabrinacarpenter.com/)

  My queen.
  I love everything about this album.
  And I really do not care who knows it.

* [Mahashmashana](https://album.link/us/i/1760456744) by [Father John Misty](https://www.fatherjohnmisty.com/)

  This album is a continuation on amazing albums put out by Father John Misty.
  I am relatively new into listening to their discography, but I have been obsessed with everything they have put out.
  This is a very strong addition to their amazing catalogue.

* [Lola](https://album.link/us/i/1716490429) by [Goth Babe](https://www.gothbabemusic.com/)

  What a surprise this album was.
  I remember walking by a marquee with "Goth Babe" headlining a show and laughing at the name.
  I never imagined it would be on the list of top albums of the year.
  It is such a great listen.

* [Country](https://album.link/us/i/1731464507) by [Medium Build](https://www.mediumbuildmusic.com/)

  Very much like Father John Misty, there is an absolute treat listening to Medium Build.
  I have enjoyed "Be Your Boy" for ages and to have a whole new album is just fantastic.
  It is raw.
  It is real.
  And it was a great concert to see live this year.

* [GNX](https://album.link/us/i/1781270319) by [Kendrick Lamar](https://oklama.com/)

  After the beef with Drake, I did not know there would be more.
  But this album is great.
  It probably has the strongest 3 songs in a row that I can remember.
  I will forever be listening to "hey now", "reincarnated" and "tv off" back to back to back.

* [TANGK](https://album.link/us/i/1708015501) by [IDLES](https://www.idlesband.com/)

  IDLES snuck up on me and this album is just fantastic.
  I am so glad I found this album and their whole catalogue.
  Great music.

* [BRAT](https://album.link/us/i/1739079974) by [Charli xcx](https://www.charlixcx.com/)

  It was certainly a BRAT summer here.
  Though I have to admit I do think I enjoy the "Brat and it's completely different but also still brat" remixes.
  Give them all a listen though!


## New (to me) Albums of 2024

* [The Money Store](https://album.link/us/i/515449028) (2012) by [Death Grips](https://thirdworlds.net/)

  I am not too sure what took me so long to get into Death Grips.
  But I have certainly been experimenting more with noise music overall, and they fit a happy niche for me.

* [Lean Into Life](https://album.link/us/i/1650300996) (2023) by [Petey](https://www.peteyswebsite.com/)

  I did not understand how much I needed Petey in my life.
  Every song they sing hits the core of my soul.
  It's really magic.

* [Being Kind](https://starslingeruk.bandcamp.com/album/being-kind-lp) (2022) by Star Slinger

  Star Slinger really surprised me with this one.
  I have been following them for a while since I first heard their single [Supermane](https://youtu.be/ew-vfxBkhp8).
  This album was a great collection of tunes I listened to a lot.

* [Cave World](https://album.link/us/i/1616538091) (2022) by [Viagra Boys](https://www.vboysstockholm.com/)

  Not sure where I first heard them, but I could not stop listening to Viagra Boys.
  The whole band is amazingly talented and are great performers.
  I hope to see them live one day!

## Top Singles of 2024

For each of the singles, I pulled the Youtube video for them.
I have started to have a renewed appreciation for music videos and none of these disappoint.

* [Tispy - Tipsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVn4Teq2SMY) by clipping.

  I love everything Daveed Digs and these gentlemen do.
  This is just a lovely cover to an already great song!

* [Guillotine - Guillotine](https://youtu.be/Orlbo9WkZ2E) (2011) by Death Grips

  This is now my goto song to introducing people to Death Grips.
  It has it all.
  Definitely worth a listen!

* [Sprinter - Sprinter](https://youtu.be/pSY3i5XHHXo) (2023) by Central Cee & Dave

  This song has been a super ear worm for me all year.
  I would say that this single handedly got me into [UK Drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_drill) music and I am so happy to have been introduced.

* [Torch - Drop 7](https://youtu.be/MUe7PCJ9FE8) (2024) & [Point and Kill - Sometimes I Might Be Introvert](https://youtu.be/tvY31eN3gtE) (2021) by Little Simz

  These two songs were also part of my constant rotation of UK Drill this year.

* [Memory Box - Bismillah](https://youtu.be/8ob0J3gi6b8) (2019) by Peter Cat Recording Co.

  This song is amazingly fun to listen to.
  It reminds me of some soulful disco.
  It is really a vibe.

* [Ziggy Starfish (Anxiety Raps) - A Special Episode - EP](https://youtu.be/R3ib9gCw1F4) (2015) by Open Mike Eagle
* [Legend Has It - Run The Jewels 3](https://youtu.be/vWaljXUiCaE) (2016) by Run the Jewels
* [Rubbernecker - Viscerals](https://youtu.be/WV2w2395jZo) (2020) by Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs
