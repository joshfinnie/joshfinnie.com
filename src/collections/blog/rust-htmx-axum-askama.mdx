I recently have had a growing interest in [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).
I have been wondering if it could be used for a full-fledged website.
Most importantly, could HTMX replace my use of JavaScript (React.js or Next.js) completely?

Also, as you might know, I am a huge fan of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
So for this tutorial, I really wanted to use [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) for the server component.
This worked out pretty well, I really enjoy Axum's builtin workflows.

Rust also has a great templating crate called [Askama](https://djc.github.io/askama/askama.html).
It implements a template rendering engine based on [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/).
Developing in Python for most of my career, Jinja is something I am familiar with; an added plus!
In this blog post, we'll explore how to build a simple web-based todo application using Rust, leveraging the Axum framework for web services and Askama for templating.

## Building an Todo Application

First off, we will need to create a new project.
We do that using `cargo` running the below commands:

```bash
$ cargo new rust_todo
$ cd rust_todo
```

Next, we want to add the crates we need for this project.
This can be done by running the `cargo add` command or modifying the `Cargo.toml` file directly.
Whichever way you do this, make sure your `Cargo.toml` dependencies looks like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.5"
askama = "0.11"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Once this is complete, we can go ahead and build out a simple Axum application we will build off of:

```rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // build our application with a route
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(handler));

    // run it
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn handler() -> Html<&'static str> {
    Html("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
}
```

### Breaking Down the Todo Application

First, we want to add some way to save our todos.
We can use `lazy_static` to create a global, mutable `Vec<String>` wrapped in a `Mutex` to store our tasks.
This approach is simplistic and serves well for demonstration purposes.
More than likely you would want the to be saved to a database, but that is beyond the scope we are discussing here.
To implement this, we will add the following code:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;

// Define a global shared state for storing tasks
lazy_static! {
    static ref TASKS: Mutex<Vec<String>> = Mutex::new(vec![]);
}
```

Next we define an HTML template for our todo list using Askama.
The template is a multi-line raw string literal.
You could save this in a file, but again it makes the application more complicated.
Keeying it inline to our main application just keeps it more readable and maintainable.

```rust
use askama::Template;

// Define the HTML template using Askama
#[derive(Template)]
#[template(
    inline = r#"
        <h1>Todo List</h1>
        <form action="/add" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="task"/>
        <input type="submit" value="Add Task"/>
        </form>
        <ul>
        {% for task in tasks %}
        <li>{{ task }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    "#
)]
struct TodoListTemplate<'a> {
    tasks: &'a Vec<String>,
}
```

To get the Axum application to work with the above template, we define two routes.
One of these routes will be used to display tasks (`show_tasks`)
The other route will be used to add a new task (`add_task`).
**Note**: We will no longer need our generic handler that came with the "hello world" application and will delete it here.

```rust
use axum::{
    http::StatusCode,
    response::Html,
    routing::{get, post},
    Router,
    extract::Form,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // build our application with a route
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(show_tasks))
        .route("/add", post(add_task));

    // run it with hyper on localhost:3000
    axum::Server::bind(&"127.0.0.1:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
};
```

For these new routes, lets create some functions that will interact with our global list of todos.
The `show_tasks` function renders the current list of tasks using the template.
The `add_task` function handles POST requests from the form, adding a new task to our global list of todos.
`add_task` also needs a `struct` to help with deserialization from the `Form`.

```rust
// Handler to display tasks
async fn show_tasks() -> Html<String> {
    let tasks = TASKS.lock().unwrap();
    let template = TodoListTemplate { tasks: &tasks };
    Html(template.render().unwrap())
}

// Handler to add a new task
async fn add_task(Form(input): Form<AddTask>) -> StatusCode {
    let mut tasks = TASKS.lock().unwrap();
    tasks.push(input.task);
    StatusCode::SEE_OTHER
}

#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct AddTask {
    task: String,
}
```

In the end, adding everything we talked about in this post, we should have a file that looks like this:

```rust
use axum::{
    http::StatusCode,
    response::Html,
    routing::{get, post},
    Router,
    extract::Form,
};
use askama::Template;
use std::sync::Mutex;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;

// Define a global shared state for storing tasks
lazy_static! {
    static ref TASKS: Mutex<Vec<String>> = Mutex::new(vec![]);
}

// Define the HTML template using Askama
#[derive(Template)]
#[template(
    inline = r#"
        <h1>Todo List</h1>
        <form action="/add" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="task"/>
        <input type="submit" value="Add Task"/>
        </form>
        <ul>
        {% for task in tasks %}
        <li>{{ task }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    "#
)]
struct TodoListTemplate<'a> {
    tasks: &'a Vec<String>,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // build our application with a route
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(show_tasks))
        .route("/add", post(add_task));

    // run it with hyper on localhost:3000
    axum::Server::bind(&"127.0.0.1:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}

// Handler to display tasks
async fn show_tasks() -> Html<String> {
    let tasks = TASKS.lock().unwrap();
    let template = TodoListTemplate { tasks: &tasks };
    Html(template.render().unwrap())
}

// Handler to add a new task
async fn add_task(Form(input): Form<AddTask>) -> StatusCode {
    let mut tasks = TASKS.lock().unwrap();
    tasks.push(input.task);
    StatusCode::SEE_OTHER
}

// Structure to receive form data
#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct AddTask {
    task: String,
}
```

## Conclusion

By enhancing a basic Axum application with HTMX, we've created a simple yet functional todo list web application in Rust.
We already knew Rust's capability in web api development, but hopefully this is providing a strong foundation for building more complex, performance-critical web services.

Remember, this implementation is basic and lacks features like persistent storage, error handling, and user authentication.
These are crucial for a production-grade application and can be added as next steps in learning Rust web development.
I am really hoping to come out with a part 2 of this post where we add a lot of these missing features.

Rust, with its growing ecosystem, is proving to be a viable option for web development, offering safety, speed, and concurrency.
Happy coding!
