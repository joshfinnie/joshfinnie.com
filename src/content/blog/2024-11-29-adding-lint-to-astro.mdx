## Introduction

As a developer passionate about clean, efficient codebases, I'm always seeking tools to enhance my workflow.
My Astro blog combines my love for development with creative blogging.
As the project grew, maintaining consistent code quality across files and components became challenging.
I needed tools to enforce coding standards, reduce errors, and improve collaboration.

Enter **Prettier** and **ESLint** — two powerful tools that improve code consistency and catch potential issues early.
Prettier formats every file uniformly, saving hours of manual formatting work.
ESLint identifies and flags problematic patterns in my code.
In this post, I'll show you how I integrated these tools into my Astro blog, share the benefits I've seen, and explain why you should consider them for your projects.

## What is Prettier and What is it Used For?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style.
It automatically enforces formatting rules like indentation, line breaks, and quote usage, eliminating the need for manual formatting.
This removes style debates from teams, letting developers focus on writing functionality.

Prettier works seamlessly with most editors, formatting code on save.
It supports JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like Astro.
By automating formatting, it creates a clean, professional codebase that's easier to read and maintain.

## What is ESLint and What is it Used For?

ESLint finds and fixes problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
It analyzes code for syntax errors, unused variables, and patterns that might cause bugs.
Beyond error detection, it enforces coding standards and best practices, making your codebase both functional and maintainable.

ESLint's plugin architecture allows customization for any project.
It works with frameworks like Astro and integrates with tools like Prettier.
While Prettier handles formatting, ESLint focuses on code logic and structure.
Adding it to your workflow helps catch issues early, reduces debugging time, and improves code quality.

## Why Use Both Prettier and ESLint?

For growing projects like an Astro blog, maintaining a clean codebase is crucial.
Prettier and ESLint address this from complementary angles, forming a powerful combination.

Prettier automates code formatting for consistent style.
It handles indentation, spacing, and line breaks, eliminating manual adjustments and style debates.
This lets you focus on writing code rather than arguing about formatting.

ESLint examines code logic and structure.
It catches bugs, enforces best practices, and flags issues early.
With its ability to enforce standards and suggest fixes, it improves code reliability and maintainability.

Together, they're unbeatable.
Prettier keeps code looking sharp, while ESLint ensures it's clean and functional.
This creates a codebase that's not only visually consistent but also robust and reliable, improving the developer experience.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Prettier and ESLint

### 1. Set Up Prettier

1.1. Install Prettier:

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-astro
```

1.2. Create a `.prettierrc.mjs` file for your configuration:

```javascript
// .prettierrc.mjs
/** @type {import("prettier").Config} */
export default {
  plugins: ["prettier-plugin-astro"],
};
```

1.3. Add a `.prettierignore` file to exclude files/folders:

```plaintext
dist/
src/components/ui/
src/content/**/*.md
src/content/**/*.mdx
```

1.4. Add Prettier to your scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "format": "prettier --write ."
}
```

### 2. Set Up ESLint

2.1. Install ESLint for Astro:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

2.2. Initialize ESLint:

```bash
npx eslint --init
```

- Choose configuration options (e.g., modules, language, and whether to enforce formatting rules).

  2.3. Configure ESLint for Astro in `eslint.config.mjs`:

```javascript
// eslint.config.mjs
import globals from "globals";
import pluginJs from "@eslint/js";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";


/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.Config[]} */
export default [
  {files: ["**/*.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,astro}"]},
  {languageOptions: { globals: {...globals.browser, ...globals.node} }},
  pluginJs.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,
];⏎
```

### 3. Integrate Prettier with ESLint

3.1. Install the Prettier plugin for ESLint and the Astro plugin for ESLint:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended eslint-plugin-astro
```

3.2. Update `eslint.config.mjs` to include Prettier rules:

```javascript
// eslint.config.mjs
import globals from "globals";
import pluginJs from "@eslint/js";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";

import eslintPluginAstro from 'eslint-plugin-astro';
import eslintPluginPrettierRecommended from 'eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended';


/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.Config[]} */
export default [
  {files: ["**/*.{js,mjs,cjs,ts,astro}"]},
  {languageOptions: { globals: {...globals.browser, ...globals.node} }},
  pluginJs.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,
  ...eslintPluginPrettierRecommended,
  ...eslintPluginAstro.configs.recommended,
];⏎
```

## The Benefits I’ve Noticed

Adding Prettier and ESLint to my Astro blog has transformed the way I write and manage code, delivering noticeable improvements across several key areas.

### Improved Code Consistency

The first thing I noticed was how effortlessly consistent my code became.
Prettier handles all formatting decisions — from semicolons to bracket alignment to quote styles.
This consistency eliminates manual adjustments and style debates.
Whether it's just me working on different days or a team effort, everyone follows the same format.
The result?
A codebase that's clean, professional, and easier to maintain.

### Fewer Bugs and Errors

ESLint has been a game-changer for reducing bugs and catching issues early.
It spots problems like unused variables, undefined imports, and potentially problematic function calls.
Once, it caught a typo in an import statement that could have caused a production issue — saving hours of debugging.
By catching errors during linting, ESLint ensures code that's both stylistically sound and functionally robust.

### Enhanced Developer Experience

These tools have significantly improved my development experience.
With automated formatting and linting, I spend less time on manual formatting and error checking.
Instead, I focus on building features and writing content. Even routine tasks like refactoring feel smoother because these tools handle the repetitive work.

### Streamlined Collaboration

Though my Astro blog is mainly a solo project, these tools would make team collaboration seamless.
Prettier ensures consistent code style, while ESLint maintains shared coding standards.
This reduces friction in code reviews and makes it easier to hand off code. Even as a solo developer, this foundation makes me confident about my blog's maintainability.

By integrating Prettier and ESLint, I've created a development environment that prioritizes both code quality and developer happiness.
These aren't just helpful tools — they're essential for any developer who values efficiency and quality.

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

Setting up Prettier and ESLint wasn't without challenges, but solving them was rewarding.
The main issue was conflicting rules between the tools.
ESLint would flag formatting issues that Prettier had already handled, creating redundant warnings.
I solved this by adding the `eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended` package to my ESLint config.
This package disables ESLint's formatting rules, letting Prettier handle formatting while ESLint focuses on code quality.

Another hurdle was the `eslint.config.json` file. This newer configuration approach lacks extensive documentation, and the add-on packages made it more complex.
Fortunately, once set up correctly, this file rarely needs changes.

These challenges taught me about fine-tuning tools for Astro. While initial setup required effort, the resulting smooth workflow was worth it.

## Conclusion

Adding Prettier and ESLint to my Astro blog has been transformative.
These tools have elevated my workflow, ensuring consistent, clean, and error-free code.
Prettier handles formatting effortlessly, while ESLint catches potential bugs and enforces best practices.
Together, they've streamlined development, reduced technical debt, and improved code collaboration.

For any project — whether an Astro blog, JavaScript library, or anything else — I highly recommend these tools.
Setup is straightforward, and the benefits are lasting.
Clean, maintainable code is an investment that pays off with every feature and refactor.
Try Prettier and ESLint in your next project — you won't regret it!
