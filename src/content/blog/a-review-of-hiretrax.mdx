As I spoke about in my [last blog post](/blog/review-of-buildspace-nights-weekends/), I had the amazing opportunity to participate in the last BuildSpace Nights & Weekends class.
I talked a lot about how the class was overall, but did not really go indepth in my project I built.
I thought it would be good to share some of my thoughts about building a project in six weeks.
Things I learned, things I would do again, and things I would not.
