## Introduction

> The Collections library implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

Back when I was running weekly coding challenges at PBS for the engineering team, we ran into cases where the [Collections library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) was extremely useful.
And just recently at my new job, they came up again.
It got me thinking; do enough people know how useful this library is?
Let's go into what I use in the Collections library in some detail!
