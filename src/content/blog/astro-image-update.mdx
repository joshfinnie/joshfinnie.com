I was looking around the [Astro.js Docs](https://docs.astro.build/) the other day and came across an experimental feature to replace [@astrojs/image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/).
This is super exciting to me since I have never had the ability to use the later for some reason.
