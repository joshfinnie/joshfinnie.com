I read an article recently about generating a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) in python.
But once getting through the tutorial, it did not work for me.
I thought this was a great concept and went down a rabbit hole to fix the code.
Since I did all this work to create a [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) QR code in python, I thought I would share.

## Introduction

### QR Codes

Throughout the pandemic, at least in the United State, QR codes have become more and more ubiquious at resturants and bars. Though, if you have not heard of a QR code before let me define it for you.

> A QR (short for "quick-response") code is a a machine-readable code consisting of an array of black and white squares, typically used for storing URLs or other information for reading by the camera on a smartphone.

These neat images can share a lot of information quickly.
They are used to link to a URL that will download a resturant's menu or drinks list.
They can be used to download an image to your phone.
And in this example they can store vCard information to share your contact data.

### vCard

vCard is probably a little less known to many. But it is a data format that stores your contact data.
iOS and Android can both use vCard to download your contact information into someone else's phone.

> vCard (or virtual business card) an electronic representation of a business card, usually a file attached to an email in place of a signature.

Converting this data into a QR code is pretty easy using a few Python packages and makes for a cool image to share with your contacts.

## Let's Code

The first thing we need to do is to become comfortable with the vCard code format. Below I show the smallest working vCard code that will work for our situtation:

```vcard
BEGIN:VCARD
VERSION:3.0
FN:Josh Finnie
END:VCARD
```

vCard defines many different properties that can be added; I do not use them all in the slightest, but find what works best for you.
The [vCard Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) has a list of all of them.
For me, this is what I went with:

```python
vcard = f"""BEGIN:VCARD
VERSION:3.0
N:Finnie;Josh;;;
FN:Josh Finnie
BDAY:19831014
ADR;type=HOME:;;;Charlotte;North Carolina;28203;United States
TEL;type=CELL:8607165996
TZ:America/New_York
EMAIL;type=PERSONAL,INTERNET:josh@jfin.us
ORG:People Data Labs;
TITLE:Senior Software Engineer
EMAIL;type=WORK,INTERNET:josh.finnie@peopledatalabs.com
URL:https://www.joshfinnie.com
REV:{datetime.now()}
END:VCARD"""
```

You can see above, I put my birth day, home address, cell phone number, email, and work data.
I find this is a great list of data I would wish new contacts to have.
Again feel free to add as many or as few as you'd like.


Now that we have the data we want to
