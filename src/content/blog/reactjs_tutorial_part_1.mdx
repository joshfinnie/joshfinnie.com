Welcome to my tutorial on how to get a website up and running using [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). I am expecting this to be a multipart tutorial as we go through building a job board for my local [Node.js Meetup Group](), though I am not sure how long these tutorials will last. I hope you enjoy them and if so feel free to share them! You can follow along with my progression on my jobs.nodedc.com [github repo](https://github.com/joshfinnie/jobs.nodedc.com)

## Getting Started with Express

In this tutorial I am going to assume you have Node.js installed since it is becomming standard in so many of today's build processes. If you do not have it installed, check out [this article](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs).

The first thing we are going to do is set up a standard [express](http://expressjs.com/) app. This is easy do to through `express-generator`. Install `express-generator` using the following command:

```bash
$ npm install express-generator -g
```

Once installed, we are going to create a basic express app. To generate this express app, we run the following command:

```bash
$ express jobs.nodedc.com

create : jobs.nodedc.com
create : jobs.nodedc.com/package.json
create : jobs.nodedc.com/app.js
create : jobs.nodedc.com/public
create : jobs.nodedc.com/public/javascripts
create : jobs.nodedc.com/public/stylesheets
create : jobs.nodedc.com/public/stylesheets/style.css
create : jobs.nodedc.com/routes
create : jobs.nodedc.com/routes/index.js
create : jobs.nodedc.com/routes/users.js
create : jobs.nodedc.com/public/images
create : jobs.nodedc.com/views
create : jobs.nodedc.com/views/index.jade
create : jobs.nodedc.com/views/layout.jade
create : jobs.nodedc.com/views/error.jade
create : jobs.nodedc.com/bin
create : jobs.nodedc.com/bin/www

install dependencies:
    $ cd jobs.nodedc.com && npm install

run the app:
    $ DEBUG=jobs.nodedc.com ./bin/www
```

With the output of `express-generator` we can see that we are well on our way to what we need from Express. This is a bit overkill, but with a few small changes, we should have a working express app which will then run (eventually) our API and serve our React site.

Let's start up this generated site and see what we get. Below is the image that you should see in your browser (at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) if you are following along.

<img src={helloExpress.src} alt="Hello Express.js" />

I then recommend going through the generated code and cleaning it up a little bit. We will not need the `user` routes so I just deleted them. I also expanded on the `package.json` some to add a description and keywords as well as changed the version to something more reasonable.

## Adding React.js

Now that we have a pretty basic express application as our backend, we are now going to jump into adding react. Adding react is not that difficult, but there are a few ways of doing things. Since we are already within a node.js app, I am going to go down the route of building our jsx scripts into javascript. To get ready for this, we need to install the `react-tools` node package. You can do that by the following command:

```bash
$ npm install react-tools --save-dev
```

We add the `--save-dev` flag to make sure the `react-tools` package is saved as a development requirement in our `package.json`. Now, to convert the jsx scripts to javascript, we just have to run the following command:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/react-tools/bin/jsx public/javascripts/src/ public/javascripts/build/
```

** Note: ** You could also install `react-tools` globlally if you'd like.

Next we want to [download React 0.12.2](http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads/react-0.12.2.zip), extract, and move `react-0.12.2/build/react.min.js` to our `/public/javascripts/build/` directory. Let's add React.js to our template! The default templating language for `express-generator` is [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). It is a bit difficult to comprehend at first (and `express-generator` allows you to substitute either [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) if you are more comfortable with those), but I find it super simplistic!

To add `react.min.js` to our templates, we just append it to the bottom of our `views/layout.jade` file as below:

```pug
doctype html
html
head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
body
    block content
    script(src='/javascripts/build/react.min.js')
```

Rerunning `DEBUG=jobs.nodedc.com ./bin/www` we should see our starting screen again, but now it's React.js ready. Now our templates should be ready for our React Components!

## Adding a React.js Component

Now that we have our express app running react.js, we can now start the process of writing our react application. In this part of the tutorial, we are only going to do a basic "Hello World" component, but next time we will start developing the components we need for our job board. So first, let's create our component.

The first thing we want to do is create the `div` needed for react. In the `views/index.jade` file, add a div with an `id` of "example". With jade, your `index.jade` file should look like this:

```pug
extends layout

block content
    #example
```

Next we want to create a simple react.js component in our `public/javascripts/src/` folder called `helloworld.jsx`. This component should look like:

```javascript
React.render(<h1>Hello, world from React.js!</h1>, document.getElementById("example"));
```

Because we are using the `react-tools` node package, we want to add the compiled javascript code to our templates. Change you `views/layout.jade` file to the following:

```pug
doctype html
html
head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
body
    block content
    script(src='/javascripts/build/react.min.js')
    script(src='/javascripts/build/helloworld.js')
```

And run the `react-tools` package to compile our component with the following command:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/react-tools/bin/jsx -x jsx public/javascripts/src/ public/javascripts/build/
```

Remember to use the `-x` flag as we used the extension `.jsx` for our jsx code. Now running the express server again we should see:

<img src={helloReact.src} alt="hello react" />

There we have it. A pretty simple Hello World app with React.js and Express.js. Next we will clean up this process with some automation help from [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and start building react.js components to help us with our NodeDC job board!
