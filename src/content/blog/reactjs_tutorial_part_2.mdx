Welcome to part 2 of my tutorial on how to get a website up and running using [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). You can read Part 1 [here](/blog/reactjs-tutorial-part-1/) if you haven't already.

In this part of the tutorial, we are going to make our React.js/Express.js app more like a full-fledged web application with the addition of a build system called [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). Gulp.js is a build system (or task runner) that I have been using for a while. There are [many](http://gruntjs.com/), [many](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli), [many](http://webpack.github.io/) out there, but I find Gulp.js to be very sufficient for my needs.

## Installing Gulp

Installing Gulp is very similar as to how we installed Express in the last tutorial, we need to add the `--save-dev` flag to save gulp to our `devDependencies` portion of the `package.json` file. Run:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp
```

Now with Gulp installed, we can create our basic `gulpfile.js` file:

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

gulp.task("default", function () {
  // place code for your default task here
});
```

Now we need to install the Gulp packages that we will need to build our application. To start, let's install [browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify), [reactify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactify) and [vinyl-source-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl-source-stream). To install these packages, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev react browserify reactify vinyl-source-stream
```

At this point, we can remove `react-tools` from our `devDependencies` since we no longer need to build our `.jsx` files via the command line. Your `devDependencies` should look like this:

```javascript
"devDependencies": {
    "browserify": "^8.1.3",
    "gulp": "^3.8.10",
    "react": "^0.12.2",
    "reactify": "^1.0.0",
    "vinyl-source-stream": "^1.0.0"
}
```

### Setting up Gulp

The next step is to set up Gulp to automatically build our `.jsx` files into usable javascript. To do this, we are going to create a Gulp task. A Gulp task is a function that will stream a bunch of steps transforming our `.jsx` to javascript. We will need to modify our `gulpfile.js` to look like this:

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

var browserify = require("browserify");
var reactify = require("reactify");
var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");

gulp.task("js", function () {
  browserify("./public/javascripts/src/app.jsx")
    .transform(reactify)
    .bundle()
    .pipe(source("app.js"))
    .pipe(gulp.dest("public/javascripts/build/"));
});

gulp.task("default", ["js"]);
```

Now running `gulp` from the command line will trigger the build of our React app; however, there are some things we need to do to our react app first!

### Browserifying React

There are some things we need to do to our application before browserify will work. Last tutorial we wrote a `helloworld.jsx`, now we need to modify this slightly to work with browserify. If you don't know browserify is a tool for compiling node-flavored commonjs modules for the browser. So let's modify our React code to work with browserify.

First, we need to create an "entry point" for browersify, we can do this by simply creating an `app.jsx` file:

```javascript
var React = require("react");
var HelloWorld = require("./HelloWorld.jsx");

React.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById("example"));
```

This file is taking our `HelloWorld` component and rendering it in the div with id "example". This code is taken from our original `helloworld.jsx` file from last tutorial. Instead of doing everything in that file, we are now requiring a module `HelloWorld` and rendering it in `app.jsx`. The reason for this is that as our application gets more complex, we have more control of how our files are broken out.

The next thing is that we have is modify our existing `helloworld.jsx` file to be a React component named `HelloWorld.jsx`. This is easily done and our `HelloWorld.jsx` file now looks like this:

```javascript
var React = require("react");

module.exports = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>Hello, world from a React.js Component!</h1>;
  },
});
```

Notice that the `HelloWorld.jsx` and `app.jsx` files are combined to be very similar to how the 'helloworld.jsx' looked. Again, the reason for breaking our app into these two files are for future modules to be added.

Now, running `gulp` will create a javascript file in `public/javascripts/build/` called `app.js` and it will have everything we need to run our React app. Let's add this to our `layout.jade` file instead of the `react.min.js` and `helloworld.js` files:

```html
doctype html html head title= title link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css') body block content
script(src='/javascripts/build/app.js')
```

There you have it, a React application being built with Gulp using browersify!

<img src={helloReactComponent.src} alt="hello react.js component" />

### Gulp Watch

To make Gulp even better, let's implement the built-in `watch` functionality to have gulp watch for changes in our `.jsx` files and automatically build our javascript. To do this, we want to add the following task to our `gulpfile.js`:

```javascript
gulp.task("watch", function () {
  gulp.watch("public/javascripts/src/**/*.jsx", ["js"]);
});
```

Also add that task to your default Gulp task:

```javascript
gulp.task("default", ["js", "watch"]);
```

Now when we run `gulp` it will watch for changes in our `.jsx` and rebuild our javascript with that change! Awesome!

### Next Time

Next time we will continue to use Gulp to build out some more niceties when building a web application, introduce [Bower](http://bower.io/), and finally get to building some of the React Components we will use in our job board.
