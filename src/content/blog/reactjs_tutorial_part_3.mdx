Welcome to part 3 of my React.js/Express.js app tutorial. In this part we are going to actually take a deep dive into react and start hashing out the application's components. If you haven't already, please start the tutorial at [Part 1](/blog/reactjs-tutorial-part-1/)

## A React Component

From the [React Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html), "React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React the only thing you do is build components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy." This is what drew me to React in the first place, coming from [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) the idea of components spoke to me. It seemed like React's components were the next logical step in the progression of Javascript's MVCs. Here we are going to try our hardest to stay true to the definition of a React Component and try to truly encapsulate a single idea of our web application per React component. First, let's see what this means in regards to our job board web application.

## The Job Component

This first encapsulated part of our web application is going to be the job posting itself. Here we want to create a component that simply lists the information that we should have in an individual job post. To start, lets create a file for this react component and let's call it `Job.jsx` and put it in our `public/javascripts/scr/` folder:

```javascript
var React = require("react");

module.exports = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>Job Title</h1>;
  },
});
```

This file might look surprisingly similar to our `HelloWorld.jsx` file and that is because it is! Of course we want to add some functionality to our `Job` component, but first let's get it hooked up into our application. To do this, we will need to modify our `app.jsx` file slightly to use the `Job` component instead of the `HelloWorld` component. To do this, modify the `app.jsx` file to read as the following:

```javascript
var $ = (jQuery = require("../../libraries/jquery/dist/jquery"));
var bootstrap = require("../../libraries/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/javascripts/bootstrap");
var React = require("react");
var HelloWorld = require("./Job.jsx");

React.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById("job-post"));
```

**Please note** we also changed the HTML element we are attaching our React app to from `example` to `job-post` so make sure to adjust your `index.jade` file to match. Running `gulp` and then serving your application, you should see a header title of "Job Title" instead of our "Hello World" text from the last couple of tutorials. Now let's add some information to this component and really make it look like a job posting!

### Adding Information to our Component

To add some useful information to our `Job` component, we want to create an "initial state" for the component. This over simplifies the task of getting data into your component, but it will work for us right now. In the `Job.jsx` file, we want to create a function called `getInitialState` and return a dictionary with the information we want our component to start with. Once we do that, we want to change our rendering element to use the initialized state. Below you will see what changes we made to `Job.jsx` to accomplish this:

```javascript
var React = require("react");

module.exports = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    return {
      company: "TrackMaven",
      position: "Software Maven",
      local: "Washington, DC, USA",
      lookingFor: "Angular.js, Django, ElasticSearch",
      postedDate: "4 April 2015",
      description: "",
      category: "Engineer",
    };
  },

  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2 class="listing-company">
          <span class="listing-company-name">{this.state.company}</span>
          <span class="listing-location">{this.state.local}</span>
        </h2>
        <span class="listing-job-type">Looking for: {this.state.lookingFor}</span>
        <span class="listing-posted">Posted: {this.state.postedDate}</span>
        <span class="listing-company-category">{this.state.category}</span>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

Note that with the `getInitialState` function, the `render` function now has access to a useful state. We can cycle through the state to render the data in our app. Our web application should now look like this:

<img src={filledOutComponent.src} alt="filled out job component" />

### Adding More Components (Components within Components)

Having a job posting is great and all, but we are not doing all this work to just post a single job. We need a way to iterate through a list of jobs and render many `Job` components. This isn't as hard as it sounds, we first need to create another component, though. Let's call this component `Jobs` since it's going to create many `Job` components. To keep our codebase as clean as possible, we are going to create another file to hold our `Jobs` component; we are going to call it `Jobs.jsx`.

In the `Jobs` component, we are going to map all the jobs to individual `Job` components, but for this part of the tutorial, we are still going to hard-code the data. First, we want to create an "initial state" that is going to mirror our future API call. This is done through the `getInitialState` function in our `Jobs` component. Looping over this data to render many components is easy in React.js, but not all that intuitive. We want to use the `map()` function in Javascript to map each "job" to the `Job component`. Below is what the final `Jobs.jsx` file looks like:

```javascript
var React = require("react");
var Job = require("./Job.jsx");

module.exports = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    // This will be an API call eventually...
    return {
      data: [
        {
          company: "TrackMaven",
          position: "Software Maven",
          local: "Washington, DC, USA",
          lookingFor: "Angular.js, Django, ElasticSearch",
          postedDate: "4 April 2015",
          description: "",
          category: "Engineering",
        },
        {
          company: "TrackMaven",
          position: "Junior Software Maven",
          local: "Washington, DC, USA",
          lookingFor: "Javascript, Python",
          postedDate: "4 April 2015",
          description: "",
          category: "Engineering",
        },
      ],
    };
  },
  render: function () {
    return (
      <div className="list-group">
        {this.state.data.map(function (job) {
          return (
            <Job
              company={job.company}
              position={job.position}
              local={job.local}
              lookingFor={job.lookingFor}
              postedDate={job.postedDate}
              description={job.description}
              category={job.category}
            />
          );
        })}
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

This allows us to clean up the `Job` component a little bit, most importantly switching from using `state` to `props` since we are now passing in the data to the `Job` component and not using our `getInitialState` function. Most of this is the same, but we made some small changes to the return function. First note the change from `class` to `className` due to some issue with React.js and how it handles the `class` namespace. Second, note we got rid of the `getInitialState` function since we now pass in the data through our `Jobs` component.

```javascript
var React = require("react");

module.exports = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <a href="#" className="list-group-item">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading listing-company">
          <span className="listing-position-name">{this.props.position}</span>
          <small className="listing-company-name">{this.props.company}</small>
          <small className="listing-location">{this.props.local}</small>
        </h4>
        <p className="list-group-item-text">
          <span className="listing-job-type">Looking for: {this.props.lookingFor}</span>
        </p>
        <p className="list-group-item-text">
          <span className="listing-posted">Posted: {this.props.postedDate}</span>
          <span className="listing-company-category">{this.props.category}</span>
        </p>
      </a>
    );
  },
});
```

Next let's add some simple SCSS in our `public/stylesheets/scss/style.scss` file to make our application look a little better. Below is all the SCSS I have added:

```sass
@import "../../libraries/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap";

body {
  padding: 50px;
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

a {
  color: #00B7FF;
}

#jobs {
    padding-top: 10px;
}

.listing-location {
  float: right;
}

.listing-company-name {
  margin-left: 10px;
}

.listing-company-category {
  float: right;
}
```

And now looking at it all put together, we now have something that looks like this!

<img src={cssComponent.src} alt="CSS-ed jobs component" />

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we went through how to create a real component and how to loop over that component with data. Our application is looking more and more like a real web app! Next time we will work through how we are going to build out our Express.js app to return some JSON jobs data and how we can make our React.js app talk to that API. See you then!
