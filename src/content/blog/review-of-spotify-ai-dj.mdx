Spotify recently [announced](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/) the launch of an AI DJ.
As someone who listens to a lot of music while working, I decided to give it a try and provide my review.
I should mention that I mostly stick to a collection of 500 liked songs, playing them on repeat.
Occasionally, I explore my Discover Weekly or Release Radar playlists if they pique my interest.
So when a good friend shared their positive experience with the AI DJ, I was intrigued.

I have to admit, I've been a bit disappointed with the AI DJ so far.
While it has introduced me to some new songs that I've added to my "liked songs" list, the overall experience has been somewhat lacking.
First of all, it categorizes songs into generic classifications and acts based on those categories.
This works well within each category, but the transition between categories feels disjointed.

To give you an example, here are some prompts I've received from the AI DJ while writing this post:

- "I heard you've been into hip hop lately, and I have some recommendations."
- "Let's go back to what you were listening to in 2020."
- "I have a song from Tyler, The Creator and similar artists."
- "Here is some hip hop from before our time together."
- "Now it's time to get into a vibe, and that vibe starts with Did You Know by Sylvan Esso."

Each of these prompts includes about 5 to 10 songs, which highlights the discontinuity even more.
Granted, we do hit a pattern of listening to hip hop, what I was listening to in 2020 feels out of place.

Overall, the Spotify AI DJ is nice.
It offers a mix of familiar songs and introduces me to new ones.
However, when I thought about an AI DJ, I imagined something more than just suggesting songs based on generic prompts.
It would be really cool if it could create an actual DJ set that seamlessly transitions between genres while maintaining coherence.
