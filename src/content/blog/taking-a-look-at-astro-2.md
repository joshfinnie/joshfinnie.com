Out of the blue (to me...), [Astro](https://astro.build) [released version 2.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/) of their amazing platform.
I have been using astro.js on this blog [for a while](/blog/my-switch-from-gatsby-to-astro/).
And the 2.0 release has brought a lot of improvements.
I am truely excited to share my thoughts here!

There are a lot of changes in Astro 2.0.
I really recommend reading the release notes.
But I want to touch on 3 exciting changes for me and this blog.

## Content Collections

I have not been this excited for a change in how I manage my blog content since I switched to Astro itself.
Content Collections are new in Astro 2.0.
And they just make sense.

> Working with Markdown/MDX is hard.

The above quote is how a lot of people feel about Markdown.
It's bolded on the [article announcing Content Collections](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-content-collections/).
And my previous experience with markdown in Astro is any example; it was not the best.

Before Content Collections, there was not a real conclusive way to handle markdown files within Astro.
This lead me to just add them to the `posts` folder which had my Astro code to display posts.
I always felt like this was never a best-practice.
It lead to a lot of mixed media files that did not have a coherient reason to be together.

## Improved Dev Server

## Vite 4.0

## Conclusion

Above I shared 3 changes in Astro 2.0 that I am very excited for.
Like I said above, there is much more to Astro 2.0 than what I went over here.
Definitely check it out yourself.
There is a great [website to try out Astro for yourself](https://astro.new/).
