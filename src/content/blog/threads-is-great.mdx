I previously wrote about [my first 24 hours with Threads](/blog/24-hours-with-threads/).
I admit in that blog post that there was a lot of potential with the budding social media platform.
Now that Threads is six months old, I thought it would be time to reevaluate.
And so not to bury the lede, Meta has delivered.
