As I was [searching for a job](/blog/my-2023-job-search-journey/) I kept seeing jobs using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).
I have played around with elixir once before for Advent of Code.
I remember it was fun.
So I thought I'd take some time and write up a tutorial getting elixir and phoenix up-and-running in 2023.
