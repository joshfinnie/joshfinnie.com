Are you tired of having your `package-lock.json` changes completely flood your `git diff` making it useless? I found out a was to exclude `package-lock.json` from your `git diff` and it's wonderful!

```bash
$ git diff -- . ':(exclude)package-lock.json'
```

I will probably make this an alias, not sure there's a reason to ever see the `package-lock.json` file? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshfinnie) if you see an issue with this!
