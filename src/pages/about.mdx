I currently work on the API &amp; Delivery team at [People Data Labs](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/).
I am an experienced polyglot software engineer who's specialties lie in building large-scale, complex APIs, interactive websites and internal tooling.
I have over 10 years of software development experience ranging from the fast-paced world of startups to working on different contracts with a small, independent team of developers.
I have the expertise and ability to make your team better through my knowledge and experience and am excited to share.
