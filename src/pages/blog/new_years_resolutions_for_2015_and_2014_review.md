Last year was the first time that I published my New Year Resolutions online for the world to see. This year I am doing it again in hopes to continue getting better at them. Below you will find my 2015 resolutions and how I did in 2014.

## My 2015 Resolutions

* Participate in a collaborative open-source project as a major contributor. I did a good job in 2014, but really want to step up my game in 2015.
* Release the Android and iOS app of [BeerLedge](https://www.beerledge.com/).
* Continue to further my current open-source projects on [Github](https://github.com/joshfinnie?tab=repositories). [Archey-OSX](https://github.com/joshfinnie/archey-osx) has seen some activity lately and would love to continue that.
* Become a pilar in the DC teck scene.
* Be better at regularly blogging. (I want to post a blog entry at least once a month, weekly was just too hard!).
* Improve my programming skill levels in both Javascript and Python. (I have purposely changed the order of these two; I really like Javascript.)
* Have a talk accepted at a programming conference.
* Continue to give a talk at my local [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/members/26710252/). I gave [5 talks](http://www.joshfinnie.com/talks/) in 2014, would like to double that.
* Continue the success of Node Night and set up more [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) events after the [very successful NationJS NodeSchool](http://www.joshfinnie.com/blog/nodeschool-at-nationjs-postmortem/).
* Lose weight. I really want to hit my target goal this year; I seriously went backwards in 2014 and now realize that this is going to be harder than I ever thought... I am not 20 anymore!
* Read even more fiction books. Now that I have found audiobooks, I feel like this goal is actually attainable this year.
* Participate and complete the 2015 [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/). This is a goal I have failed at numerous times and really want to complete it!
* Make more of an effort to see friends when back in Connecticut.

I am sure there are some things I am forgetting, but it definitely feels good to take some time to write these goals out. Expect a more indepth retrospective on 2014 coming up very soon! Here's to a very Happy New Years to you and yours!
