It's that time of year again, <strike>time to set forth upon the new year and cast my hopes and dreams for 2018</strike>. Who are we kidding? I feel like this idea needs a complete reboot. As you can see in the results section below, I did horribly on my 2017 resolutions. I am not sure why, but even with the more narrow focus, I think it was just too much. I think I am going to attempt to do quarterly goals in 2018 and see if that makes everything more attainable for me.

## My 2018 Quarter 1 Resolutions

* Complete Couch to 5K.
* Write 2 blog posts.

I really think that's it. Looking at resolutions at the quarterly level is nice. I know I am going to be quite busy this quarter with traveling and what-have-you. So let's take it a bit slow and actually get something done!

## My 2017 Resolutions Results

<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Restart my efforts in blogging. Would really like to get 12+ posts out this year (1 a month).</span><br />
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Speak at a national tech conference.</span><br />
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Start to learn [Go](https://golang.org/).</span><br />
<span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-times fa-fw"></i>  Restart my React.js/Express.js tutorial. Get 1,000 readers.</span><br />
<span class="text-success"><i class="fas fa-check fa-fw"></i> Improve my photography and start publishing photos to somewhere else besides Instagram.</span><br />

## Conclusion

Well, 1 out of 5 goals completed. That is terrible. The only one I have seemed to succeed on was improving my photography. I was lucky enough to be able to take TrackMaven's employee photos. This was both very stressfull, and very exciting. I do really like portrait photography, and taking 45+ of them really gave me a lot to take away from. On a possitive note, I did get 10,000 sessions and just over 8,500 unique visitors in 2017. That's promising for actually not posting anything relevant this year. I really do want to make this blog work; so we'll see!
