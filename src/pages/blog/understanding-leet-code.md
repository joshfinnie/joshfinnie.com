I use to hate the idea of leetcode exercises.
Especially leetcode exercises on a whiteboard during interviews.
But after about six months of practice and a lot of interviews, I think I might understand why so many companies do this. 

I have to disclose and accept a lot of my privilege here.
I currently work at a stable well-paying job with a loving partner who also has a stable well-paying job.
I am a white dude who programs; this already gives me a leg up in interviewing.
I also have time and flexibility to study leet code exercises, which I understand is not the same for everyone.

That said, I now understand why leet code interviewing exists.

## What is LeetCode?

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) is a website that has a lot of coding problems ranging from easy to solve to very difficult to solve.
The website is cool, helpful, and overwhelming all at once.
It gives you a place to input code and runs your code against a plethora of test examples.

Beyond leetcode (the website), the term leetcode has been coopted to mean any coding challenge that requires knowing algorithms and optimizations to solve.
This is the leetcode I will be discussing in this post. I will rarely mean the website below, and if I do I will make sure to make the readers aware.

Let's look at a leetcode style question so everyone's on the same level of understanding.

```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may 
not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

Above is the infamous [Two Sum Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) on Leetcode.com.
It is the first question on Leetcode.com and showcases leedcode style questions perfectly.
You have a question that is a bit tricky to understand.
This allows for interaction in the interview; asking clarifiying questions, defining edge cases, understanding of basic algorithmic programming.

Of course, this question is labeled as "easy" and probably would not be asked in any advanced position interview.
But I can still go through my thoughts on why I like leetcode interviews using the question above.

## Why LeetCode?

To understand why I started to like leetcode style interviews, we first have to come to an understanding on what an interview is trying to accomplish.
After being part of a rapid growing engineering team interviewing many cadidates of different levels, I learned interviewing is an attempt to understand whether a person would join your team and perform.
That's really it.
There is certainly more to the interview process.
But shedding all the extra, unnecessary stuff I think that is all an interview should be.
