Maybe this will become a standard series for me, but after my first [WTF Recruiters](/blog/wtf-recruiters/) post, I thought I'd be on the do-not-call list for recruiters... Guess not! Although this time I was not subjected to someone telling me of his animal sacrafices to contact me, the below email was amusing none-the-less. And all I have to say is that I guess I should be flattered that my email was slightly more appealing than Derrick's.
