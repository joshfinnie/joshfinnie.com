I have never been good at keeping resolutions that I set for myself, but I thought if I put them out in the open I might be more likely to keep them. So here they go:

## My Resolutions

* Participate and complete the 2014 [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/).
* Actively participate in a collaborative open-source project.
* Continue to further my current open-source projects on [Github](https://github.com/joshfinnie?tab=repositories).
* Be better at regularly blogging. I want to post a blog entry at least once a week.
* Improve my programming skill levels in both Python and Javascript.
* Give a talk at a local [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/members/26710252/).
* Lose weight. I really want to hit my target goal this year; I made some progress in 2013, but not nearly enough.
* Read more fiction. I have far too many books on my '[to-read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2997659?shelf=to-read)' list and adding more all the time.
* Expand the feature-set and user-base of [BeerLedge](https://www.beerledge.com/).
* Get more friends visiting the DC area at a regular clip.
* Make more of an effort to see friends when back in Connecticut.
* Most importantly, get married to my beautiful fianceé.

I am sure there are some things I am forgetting, but it definitely feels good to take some time to write these goals out. Here's to a very Happy New Years to you and yours!
