I am still here. Even though it might not seem like it, and I apologize for that! I have been diving deeply into new JavaScript stuff and just haven't had time to write. But I want to. I intend to. Sorry.

Things that are on the horizon:

* The updating and continuation of my React.js tutorial. It will be refreshed and rewritten in ES2015!
* A how-to on writing NPM packages in ES2015. Check out what I did here

Again, I am sorry I have not put in the effort that I said I would here. But please stay tuned!
