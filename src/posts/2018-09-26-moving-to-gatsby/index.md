So, it was time... The base infrastructure for this blog was showing it's age and it was time to retire it for something new. That new, hot thing? [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

If you haven't been hiding under a shell for the last six months or so (and keep up with the ever changing world of JavaScript frameworks), you have probably heard of Gatsby.js by now. I will not belabor the point too much, but I wanted to give you a high-level understanding on why I made the switch from [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) to Gatsby.js.
